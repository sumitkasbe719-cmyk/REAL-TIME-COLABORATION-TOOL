## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project is a **Real-Time Code Collaboration Tool** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with **Socket.IO** for real-time communication.  

The main purpose of this project is to allow multiple users to **collaborate on code simultaneously in a virtual room**. Each change made by one user is reflected instantly on all connected clients, providing a smooth and interactive collaborative coding experience.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features Implemented  
- Create and join collaboration rooms using **Room ID**.  
- Unique room generation with **uuid**.  
- Real-time collaboration using **Socket.IO**.  
- Integrated **CodeMirror** editor with syntax highlighting.  
- User identification via **username**.  
- Responsive interface built with **React.js**.  
- Backend powered by **Node.js + Express.js**.  
- Deployment on **Render + Netlify**.
